Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
"""
#Legal variable names:

myvar = "Mohan"
my_var = "Mohan"
_my_var = "Mohan"
myVar = "Mohan"
MYVAR = "Mohan"
myvar2 = "Mohan"

"""
Illegal variable names:

2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"

"""

Multi Words Variable Names
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:
"""
#Camel Case
#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "Mohan"

#Pascal Case
#Each words starts with capital letter ;

MyVariableName="Mohan"

#snake case 
#Each word is seperated by underscore charchater

my_variable_name="Mohan"
